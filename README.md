# IBM Verse Developer Browser Extension

IBM Verse Developer Browser Extension is a browser add-on which is used in the development of applications for IBM Verse. It allows you to register your application in IBM Verse as you develop it. Applications registered with the extension are only available in the developers' local browser, and cannot be accessed from other devices.
